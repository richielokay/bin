#	Purpose: mount or unmount a drive
#		
#	NOTE: this script is meant to be placed in ~/bin/
# 		and the filename should begin with either "mount-" or "unmount-"
#		which dictates what action is taken
#	The idea is to name it something like 'mount-superduper-drive.sh'
#		and link it to 'unmount-superduper-drive.sh' so you can use it
#		as a shell script before-and-after running a scheduled SuperDuper
#		backup. This means that you do not have to have the drive
#		running all the time, screwing up Spotlight results, putting
#		extra wear and tear on the drive, etc.
#	It may have other uses as well.
#
# 	No promises/guarantees. Feel free to use/adapt/etc. 
#	Just ask for credit to remain

# HEY! DON'T FORGET TO EDIT THE 'DRIVE_NAME' LINE
# TO REFLECT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOUR COMPUTER.

	
	# Where Finder shows the drive when it is mounted
	DRIVE_NAME_SHORT="Television"


# YOU SHOULD NOT *HAVE* TO EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE
# However, if you find that the drive doesn't spin up fast enough
# You might want to increase TRIES (default is 3, shouldn't need more than 1)
TRIES=3
